# P1-VR-World

Hello, im Carlos Mendes and this is the 1st project for the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) virtual reality nanodegree.
The app is a is a simple intro to VR. You can "shoot" the cubes or use a basic UI on the ground for some visual effects.


It took me around 1 hour to complete it and the process was pretty strait foward, just had some fun with VR.

I really had some fun trying VR for the first time and i hope you do too.


In the builds folder you can  download the apk and install it in you Android device. 
Just be sure to get a [google cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) for the full and intended experience.


You can also get the full project and open it on [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com/pt) for a ride. Have fun!
